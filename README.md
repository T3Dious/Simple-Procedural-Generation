Currently you can you use this script as water waves or as RPG maps (note: I am trying to improve the performance like using jobs as demonstrated in the code, once work fine will be edited)
First of all to make the next demonstrtion more easy i will define each of the variables what it is represent: 1- Dimension: repesents the widht and the depth of the plane. 2- Resolution: determine in which level of details you want your mountains (or area or the waves). 3- UV Scale:determine in which level of details you want your demonstrate your color or the texture you are about to cover. 4- Seed: lets say it is the divergent of the noise in which scale to be applied.   6- Height: surprise from its name xD 7- Falloff Start: repesents the scale of where the falloff map should start. 8- Falloff End: repesents the scale of where the falloff map should end. 9- Speed: the speed of the waves. 10- Scale: repesents the divergent of the waves or the intensity or the noise. Alternate: a bool choice to whatever you want to make the plane move in the y axis or no

in the above image you only have to choose Is Waved then open Variables and determine the kind of waves you want.

in the above image you only have to choose Map then Mountaines then open Variables to determine the type of mountatins you want to have (you can choose this in case you want to have a mountain in a backscene or to put a mountains in the middle or area.

in the above image you only have to choose Map then Mountaines then open Variables to determine the density of mountatins you want in the area.

in the above image you only have to choose Map to have a normal map (or jungle area, apply the same way in mountains to choose the shape or jungle you wnt).
